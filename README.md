# test-datasets: NIST_NA12878

This dataset comprises sequencing performed at NIST for NA12878 (Daughter of Utah/European Ancestry). The reads are 148 bp paired-end generated on an Illumina HiSeq instrument to a depth of 300x. The test data has been downsampled to 30x and pre-filtered for reads that appear to map to chromosome 22.
