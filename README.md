# test-datasets: HBR UHR ERCC

This dataset consists of two commercially available RNA samples: [Universal Human Reference (UHR)](https://github.com/griffithlab/rnaseq_tutorial/wiki/ResourceFiles/UHR.pdf) and [Human Brain Reference (HBR)](https://github.com/griffithlab/rnaseq_tutorial/wiki/ResourceFiles/HBR.pdf). The UHR is total RNA isolated from a diverse set of 10 cancer cell lines. The HBR is total RNA isolated from the brains of 23 Caucasians, male and female, of varying age but mostly 60-80 years old. An aliquot of the [ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Control Mixes](https://github.com/griffithlab/rnaseq_tutorial/wiki/ResourceFiles/ERCC.pdf) to each sample.
